Disclaimer :
    This project is my vulkan-tutorial code base i.e. I know very little things about the API.

# VKInterface 

VKInterface (VulKan Interface, or VKI) is a bundle of functions and structures to ease the use of the Vulkan API.
The goal of this small lib is to reduce de verbosity of the API without removing the low-level aspect and performance.
Meaning that this lib is intended to be use as an optional layer to the API, not as a feature-complete renderer.
